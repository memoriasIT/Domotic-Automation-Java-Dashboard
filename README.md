# Domotic Automation in Java

This project, which is a compendium of several repositories, runs a custom solution for domotic automation.
This specific repository, has the code that drives the dashboard, able to interact with the hardware, Domoboard. The code is in Java.

There is implementation for the automation of light sensors, temperature controlled elements, light switches, motors and much more.

By using Modbus, this board is able to connect to other boards in series and communicate.
It is also possible to connect to the UI, that could be shown in whatever device able to run Java.

This was made during my university studies, so my university tutor really helped in this project.
